The setup for a CI setup is very similar in many programming languages. Different languages have different tools built for handling the continuous integration. The setups step also include the same steps as all languages, such as linting, testing and building.

In the case of a Java application, some tools include Git pre-commits for linting. With the tool, a developer can decide what styling changes will be made to the code when submitting the commit, so that all developers working in the project have the same style of coding.

For testing purposes, Junit is the most popular tool for testing Java code. The tests are automated, meaning that the hardware does the testing for the developer.

For building, some IDEs can be used. Intellij IDEA is a common tool for building the Java project.

Some alternatives for CI are using Gitlab, CircleCI, TravisCI and TeamCity.

The setup is most likely better to be in a cloud-based environment, because the team only consists of 6 members, and the project wonâ€™t be a huge project that it would need a separate self-hosted server. The additional information would be to know what end-product of the software is, whether it will become much bigger in the future and whether more developers will be hired.
